## Introduction
Hooks are a new feature introduced in **React 16.8**. They let us use React features without writing a class, allow developers to write cleaner, more reusable code.

But as usual, there are many questions surrounding React Hooks. In the official React documentation, there is a specific article discussing the rules for using Hooks, which includes:

- Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, nested functions, or try/catch/finally blocks.
- Only call Hooks at the top level.

So, why are these rules in place? Letâ€™s explore this issue together.

## Why can't we call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions?
First, let's take a look at this code snippet:
```tsx
import { ChangeEvent, useState } from "react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);

  const handleIncreaseCount = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + step);
  };

  const handleStepChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setStep(Number(e.target.value));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Step: {step}</p>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={step}
        onChange={handleStepChange}
        min="1"
      />
      <button onClick={handleIncreaseCount}>Increase Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In the code above, we use two `useState` hooks, but we only pass the default values and do not provide any **identifying keys** for the useState hooks.
So, how does React know which `state` belongs to which `useState`?
It's because **hooks rely on the call order**, if the call order is stable, React can link the `state` to the corresponding `useState`.

As long as the call order remains consistent during component render, React can determine which internal state corresponds to which hook.
Therefore, if we use hooks inside loops or conditions (like if-else statements), this can **change the call order**,
causing React to lose track of the corresponding state for each hook.

Next, let's implement a basic version of `useState` and `useEffect` together to clarify this issue.

## Creating our `useState` hook
Let's create a simple version of `React` and `useState` hook to understand how it works under the hood:

```js
const MyReact = () => {
  const useState = (initialValue) => {
    let state = initialValue; // setting initial value for state

    const setterFunction = (newState) => {
      state = newState; // setting new value for state
    }

    return [state, setterFunction];
  }

  return {
    useState
  }
}
```

In the code above, we have created `MyReact` and `useState` functions.
- `MyReact` function acts as a container for our custom hook. This design mimics the structure of the React library,
allowing us to build our own hook functionality.
- `useState` function takes an initial value and returns an array containing the current state and a setter function.
- Inside `useState`, we declare a variable `state` and initialize it with the `initialValue`.
- The `setterFunction` mimics the behavior of React `setState`, allowing users to update the state value.

Now, it's time to test it out:

```js
const { useState } = MyReact();

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(1);

  console.log(counter); // log 1
}

MyComponent(); // Initial render of the component
```

In the code above, we have created a simple component `MyComponent` that uses our custom `useState` hook.
When we call `MyComponent`, it logs the initial value of the counter, which is `1`.

### Handling state changes

Now let's try changing the state:

```js {8-10, 14}
const { useState } = MyReact();

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(1);

  console.log(counter);

  if (counter === 1) {
   setCounter(2);
  }
}

MyComponent(); // Initial render of the component
MyComponent(); // Simulate component re-rendering
```

In the updated code, we updated the counter to `2`, we put the `setCounter` inside an if statement because otherwise in
a normal React application this would cause an infinite loop.

When we update the state, this will trigger a re-render of the component.
So I simply called `MyComponent` again to simulate this re-render.

Let's see the output:
```shell
1
1
```

We expected it to log 2 statements: the first with value would be 1, and the second one would be 2.
But it logs both statements with the value of 1.

Why is that? The problem is that every time `MyComponent` is called, it invokes 2 different `useState` functions,
the value of counter changed only in the function during the first call.

### Persisting state across renders

This can be easily fixed, by moving our definition up to keep tracking the state and the changes for it.

```js {2, 4-6}
const MyReact = () => {
  let state;
  const useState = (initialValue) => {
    if (state === undefined) {
      state = initialValue; // setting initial value for state
    }

    const setterFunction = (newState) => {
      state = newState; // setting new value for state
    }

    return [state, setterFunction];
  }

  return {
    useState
  }
}
```

Let's test it again:

```shell
1
2
```

Now, it logs the expected output. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

### Handling multiple states

But in a real-world application, we can have multiple states in a component.
To do this, we need to update our React like this:

```js {2-4, 7-8, 10-12, 14-16, 18, 22-25}
const MyReact = () => {
  let state = []; // array to store state values

  let index = 0; // index to track the current hook position

  const useState = (initialValue) => {
    const localHookIndex = index; // store the current index for this hook
    index++; // increment index for the next hook call

    if (state[localHookIndex] === undefined) {
      state[localHookIndex] = initialValue; // setting initial value for state
    }

    const setterFunction = (newState) => {
      state[localHookIndex] = newState; // setting new value for state
    }

    return [state[localHookIndex], setterFunction];
  }

  // render function
  const render = (component) => {
    index = 0; // reset index for re-renders
    return component();
  }

  return {
    useState,
    render
  }
}
```

In the code above, to handle multiple states, we changed the `state` variable to **an array**.

The `index` variable is used to track the position of the hook in the state array.
Each time `useState` is called, this `index` will be incremented to ensure that each call to `useState` corresponds to a unique index in the state array.

The current value of index is stored in `locaHookIndex` before it is incremented.
This ensures that in each call to `useState`, we have the correct index for the current hook and
prevent the `setterFunction` to use wrong index, because it runs after the `useState` is called.

Finally, we added a `render` function to simulate the rendering process of a component.
It resets the `index` back to 0 each time a component is re-rendered, ensuring that each hook can properly access its respective state value.

Let's add a new state to our component:

```js {5, 8, 14-16}
const { useState, render } = MyReact();

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(1);
  const [isSubmit, setIsSubmit] = useState(false);

  console.log(counter);
  console.log(isSubmit);

  if (counter === 1) {
    setCounter(2);
  }

  if (!isSubmit) {
    setIsSubmit(true);
  }
}

render(MyComponent); // Initial render of the component
render(MyComponent); // Simulate component re-rendering
```

Output:

```shell
1
false
2
true
```

Our React works as expected, and we can now handle multiple states in a component. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

## Creating our `useEffect` hook
To create the `useEffect` hook, first rename the previous `state` array to `hooks` for better understanding,
as this array will now contain the necessary values to work with hooks.

```js {2, 10-35}
const MyReact = () => {
  let hooks = []; // array to store hooks values

  let index = 0; // index to track the current hook position

  const useState = (initialValue) => {
    // ... useState's logic
  }

  const useEffect = (callback, dependencyArray) => {
    let hasChanged = true; // track whether any dependency has changed

    const oldDependencies = hooks[index]; // retrieve the old dependencies stored at the current index

    if (oldDependencies) {
      hasChanged = false;

      // check each dependency for changes
      for (let i = 0; i < dependencyArray.length; i++) {
        const dependency = dependencyArray[i];
        const oldDependency = oldDependencies[i];

        if (!Object.is(dependency, oldDependency)) {
          hasChanged = true;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    if (hasChanged) {
      callback(); // call the effect if dependencies changed
    }

    hooks[index] = dependencyArray; // update hooks with new dependencies
    index++; // increase index for next hook
  }

  // render function
  const render = (component) => {
    index = 0; // reset index for re-renders
    return component();
  }

  return {
    useState,
    useEffect,
    render
  }
}
```

This function accepts a `callback` and a `dependencyArray` to manage side effects based on dependency changes.

A `hasChanged` flag is initialized to track whether any dependencies have changed since the last render.

The previous dependencies for the current hook index are retrieved from the `hooks` array.

If there are old dependencies, the function iterates through the `dependencyArray` to check for changes using `Object.is()`.
If any dependency has changed, `hasChanged` is set to true.

If the dependencies have changed, the provided `callback` is executed, allowing for side effects to be run.

Finally, the `hooks` array is updated with the new dependencies, and the index is incremented to prepare for the next hook call.

Let's test the hook:

```js
const { useState, useEffect, render } = MyReact();

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(1);
  const [isSubmit, setIsSubmit] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('effect');
  }, []);

  console.log(counter);
  console.log(isSubmit);

  if (counter === 1) {
    setCounter(2);
  }

  if (!isSubmit) {
    setIsSubmit(true);
  }
}

render(MyComponent); // Initial render of the component
render(MyComponent); // Simulate component re-rendering
```
Output:
```shell
effect
1
false
2
true
```
The `useEffect` hook only runs on the initial render due to its empty dependency array.

## Conclusion
This is just a very basic implementation of `React`, `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to help us understand how hooks work under the hood.
The real hooks are more complex, and perform many other things behind the scenes.

To summarize:
- **Hooks is just an array**, and `React` accesses the array using **indexes**.
- If we call hooks inside loops, conditions, **those indexes maybe different on every render**,
and this can cause each of the hook to use wrong state.
